047=This script is originally based on the software &quot;LigaManager '98 Free&quot; for Windows. <strong>League Manager Online</strong>, also developed by Frank Hollwitz, is an improved version of this application. As it is completely written in PHP, LMO can be used in many different environments, configuration and use can be done very conveniently via any web browser. With its many extensions (Addons), LMO has grown and become versatilely. Since original author Frank Hollwitz does not develop this piece of software any further, a group of developers has commited itself to improve and extend LMO in the future.
048=This script is able the handle <strong>regular leagues</strong> of different sports as well as <strong>playoffs and cups</strong>, it offers <strong>betting</strong>, <strong>player stats</strong>, support for cell-phones (<strong>WAP</strong>) and comprehensive <strong>league stats</strong>. With all the above, LMO is <strong>the solution</strong> for everyone, who wants to administer and publish results for most kind of sports.
049=This script runs independent from your browser type, because it works on the server side. However, your browser is required to support CSS in order to have these pages displayed error free. In case your webmaster makes use of the included news ticker, you'll need to turn JavaScript on.
