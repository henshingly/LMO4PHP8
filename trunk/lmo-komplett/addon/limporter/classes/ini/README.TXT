I am providing this class as is with NO WARRANTY.  You may modify this class 
as you like, but please let me know via email (raven1004@home.com) what changes you
have made so that I may update my code if it makes sense to do so.

If you have any problems with the class, please let me know what they are so that I
may fix them promptly (raven1004@home.com).

Finally, please also let me know if you are using this in any production envrionment
(or for that matter, any environment at all). I am extremely interested in finding 
out if the classes I write are useful to others or just to me.  If you are using them,
please send the link when you write (raven1004@home.com).

Thanks,
