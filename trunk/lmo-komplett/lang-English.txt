047=This script is based on my Windows-software &quot;LigaManager '98 Free&quot;. As there are many many programs for league-managers in Windows meanwhile I want to go new ways with this script.
048=The "League Manager Online" is mainly compatible to the "League Manager '98 Free", both in function as well as in usage. Some less important featuers have been dropped (for instance the starting values). Other features have been improved (e.g. the direct comparision) and new features have been added (e.g. tendences in the table and the calendar). In addition, you finally have the opportunity to administer KO-tournaments (like playoffs and cups).
049=The calculations (table/statistics) are matchday-based. Therefore matches that were rearranged to an earlier or later date won't be treated specially. They will be calculated for the matchdays they have been entered for.
050=The script is cross-browser-made (browser independent) as it works server-sided. Nevertheless, your browser should support CSS to ensure an optimum in layout. If the webmaster uses the newsticker it will only work with javascript being activated.
